# Introduction

At university, we learn about Memory Layout in C. Concepts such as Heap memory, Stack memory, BSS, etc. Whenever we discuss this type of allocation, we often see images like this:

*Memory Layout of C Program - [Source](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/memory-layout-of-c-program)*

But then some questions arise on this topic. The main question is: do we have a clear view of how this is done at a logical and physical level?

Since we're talking about allocation layout, what other models exist? What is really stored in the heap and stack? Can we do this in a virtual lab and explore it? What are the limits?

This repository will serve as the results of these investigations.
